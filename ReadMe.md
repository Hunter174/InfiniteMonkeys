## How Many Monkeys Are Needed to Write Shakespeare?  
**Based on the Infinite Monkey Theorem**

In this project, I set out to answer the age-old question: How many monkeys would it take to write Shakespeare? Using genetic algorithm-based models, each generation represents a group of learners or "monkeys" attempting to produce the complete works of Shakespeare.

### Questions to Answer

- **How many monkeys exist in a generation?**  
  Investigating the optimal population size of monkeys per generation in the simulation.

- **How many generations are needed to write Shakespeare?**  
  Exploring how many iterations are required before the monkeys succeed in generating Shakespeare's works.

- **What model implementations can be leveraged to "converge" faster?**  
  Examining various techniques and optimizations that might accelerate the convergence towards a solution.
